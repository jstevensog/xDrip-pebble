# cgm-pebble-offline
Offline pebble watchface based on the Nightscout community version
Note:  This current version is a modifcation of Kevin Lee's original cgm-pebble-offline.  It is intended for use with xDrip, not Nightscout.

As such, it is based on the cgm-pebble version 6.0 code.
There ARE NO EASTER EGGS.
Alerts have been removed except for the falling rate-of-change alerts.
This watch face is meant for patients to use with xDrip, not for parents/carers.
All notifications/alerts are generated within xDrip (except for falling rate-of-change).
Ensure you enable notifications from xDrip in the Pebble App, and enable Third Party notifications, otherwise these will NOT come through on the pebble.
